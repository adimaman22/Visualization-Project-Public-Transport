# Public Transportation Analysis Dashboard (2024)

Welcome to the **2024 Public Transportation Analysis Dashboard**, an interactive tool designed to provide valuable insights into Israel's public bus network. Public transportation plays a crucial role in urban mobility, and analyzing its efficiency can help identify areas for improvement and enhance the travel experience for the public.

## Project Overview
This dashboard leverages official government datasets from **data.gov.il** for the year 2024 to offer comprehensive insights into bus service operations. The goal is to analyze real-world data to identify inefficiencies, highlight areas for optimization, and provide actionable recommendations.

**Explore the dashboard** [here](https://visualization-project-public-transport.streamlit.app/) and uncover insights to enhance Israel's public transportation system!

## Key Features and Analysis Areas

### 1. Demand vs. Supply Analysis
- Identify regions where there is a mismatch between passenger demand and bus service frequency.
- Pinpoint areas that are **under-served**, ensuring a balanced distribution of services.

### 2. Variation Over Time
- Explore patterns in demand and availability based on hourly, daily, and weekly trends.
- Analyze peak travel hours and seasonal changes to optimize scheduling.

### 3. Identifying Low-Performance Routes
- Detect routes with the lowest adherence to scheduled departure times.
- Compare planned vs. actual trip execution to identify inefficiencies and potential improvements.

## How to Use the Dashboard
- Use the **sidebar** to navigate through different sections and insights.
- Interactive visualizations allow for filtering and drilling down into specific data points.
- Obtain recommendations based on data-driven insights.
