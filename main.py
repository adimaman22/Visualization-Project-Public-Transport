            - **Demand vs. Supply Analysis:**  
              Identify regions where there is a mismatch between passenger demand and bus service frequency.
            - **Variation Over Time:**  
              Explore patterns in demand and availability based on hourly, daily, and weekly trends.
            - **Identifying Low-Performance Routes:**  
              Detect routes with the lowest adherence to scheduled departure times by comparing planned vs. actual trip execution.
